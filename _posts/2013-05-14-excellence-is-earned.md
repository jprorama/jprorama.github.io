It is an attribution that others ascribe to you.

Open source software is familiar to most people and almost everyone benefits from it daily. The impact of the freedom to create and re-create has [spread far from it&#8217;s computer code origins][1] to re-engineer industries and influence our dialogues on rights in the digital age.

Open source runs the Internet and is at the heart of leading Internet companies today.  Open source software is frequently considered to be the best and most reliable software in the world.

The reason for the attribution of excellence is largely due to the process by which it is developed.

Open source supports open organization which enables people to work with mutual trust, knowing their investment is protected by full ownership of the outcome.

In our effort to build the [Research Computing System][2] we try to learn from and emulate the best examples of [organization and process][3] from the open source landscape.  We are working to build a community that is genuinely invested in a platform that we build together.

We choose to engage openly to earn trust, learn from others, and demonstrate our commitment to excellence.
