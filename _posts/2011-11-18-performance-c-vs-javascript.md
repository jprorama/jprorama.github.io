Jonas piqued my interest yesterday with a question about the performance of  Javascript: are we seeing JavaScript edge out traditional languages like C in performance .  So I did a quick search this morning to see what&#8217;s going on out there around this question.

Google turned up an intriguing  blog post among the top 5 for [&#8220;performance c vs javascript&#8221;][1]:

**[Is JavaScript Faster than C?][2]**

<!--more-->This blogger has framed a test around the 15-Hole Peg Solitaire game and calculating solutions to the game with object oriented implementations in multiple languages: java, javascript, c, python, php, and ruby.  His results do show an unexpected advantage to javascript in this test.

This is just one experimental configuration, of course, but the question and this example are interesting from a couple of additional angles. The first and one dear to my heart, this post is a very nice example of open science.  This &#8220;research notebook&#8221; entry highlights how open collaboration can benefit from platforms that encourage sharing and support curation, in this case [GitHub][5] and [Git][6], respectfully.  Git is a core tool for our [research computing platform][7] to which we are turning to enable experiment curation and reproduction.

The second angle from which the question is interesting is organizational. These are the kinds of questions researchers should be empowered to pose, knowing they can turn to an institute for research computing for rigorous scientific instrumentation, help with experimental design, and opportunities for funded collaboration.

I liked [Geoff&#8217;s][8] post so much, I&#8217;ve added it to my own research notebook.
