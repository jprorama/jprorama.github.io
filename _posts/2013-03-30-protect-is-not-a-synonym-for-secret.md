When we protect something, we act to secure it from loss.  Our most valued resources are not hidden. They are the ones we can all see.  The ones we know we share a stake in protecting.

In the domain of research, our most valued resource is confidence in the meaning, disposition, and provenance of the information that lies at the heart of our discoveries.

Our challenge is to build trust in our ability to protect confidence in information.

<!--more-->We are working to build that trust through transparency; to 

[openly communicate the operation of the mechanisms used to house our information][1].  This practice ensures our operations are open to inspection, review, and understanding by all concerned.  This is the same demand we place on any data set offering improvements to our methods.

Choosing an effective perspective helps simplify our understanding of complex data &#8212; the description of the environment that houses our information.  [NIST][2] has been developing [one perspective][3] that seeks to standardize the description of operations to build trust across many domains.

We are working to [leverage their standardized vocabulary to describe our operations][4] and expand the domains in which the [Research Computing System][5] is trusted

Practical necessity naturally requires support for many perspectives.  This variety of perspectives allows system builders to build, developers to develop, and users to use.  As we move forward with the overall documentation and construction of the Research Computing System, we will also build out NIST-standardized descriptions to support inspection, review and understanding of [our information system][6] by those concerned with [a NIST perspective][7].
