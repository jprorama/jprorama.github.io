Science is a social enterprise.  Whether our focus is theoretical, experimental, or computational, sharing insights and ideas is what advances science.  Computational science is now considered the third pillar of science, on par with the traditional pillars theory and experiment.  As more and more information is digitized, our focus increasingly shifts to analyzing virtual artifacts and building virtual models.  In this environment we are now all supported by the third pillar of science.  It is the natural evolution of &#8220;what if&#8221; scenarios in all domains from the physical to the virtual world.

Computation frees our imagination.  It lets us explore unlimited variety. We can build scale models to test our theories. We can exercise procedural variation to reason about our experimental processes.

Building platforms that can support the computational and social aspects of science is critically important.  Whether it&#8217;s [Galaxy][1] for next gen sequencing, [InterMine][2] for exploring data sets, the [Trans-Proteomic Pipeline][3], or [HUBzero][4] for science communities, the needs are the same.  Our science platform needs to be a scientific instrument. It needs to support repeatable experiments by exposing its own provenance and by helping to build a curated body of processes and data.

These are the needs the motivate the construction of our research computing system.  They are the philosophy that is guiding the construction of Cheaha and the services it provides.
