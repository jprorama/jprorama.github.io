One characteristic of grid computing that tends to cloud my thinking is the sheer volume of components and the complexity of the envisioned systems. This leads to the situation we get caught in all too often where we talk about the details and lose site of the outcomes.

I&#8217;m not sure if the analogies of the computing grid and electric grid have worn thin, but I think the electric grid still provides a good abstraction that supports discussing goals and the processes to achieve them rather than getting mired in the internal operations of the technology.

In that spirit, it interesting to think of grid construction efforts as an electric utility development project.

We are developing a program to supply sufficient and reliable electricity to power the modern research machinery of participating communities.

This program expands access to the emerging national, high-capacity electric power infrastructure by helping identify and acquire the necessary local infrastructure to interface with the national electric grid.

This program defines an inter-operable infrastructure that enables communities to incorporate existing local and regional energy production facilities into a resilient, sustainable electric supply framework, where the power needed to drive research machinery can be supplied across institutional boundaries.

The inter-operable infrastructure prepares communities to leverage a future commercial energy supply market and enables members to provide a renewed focus on the development and support of research machinery by driving down the overhead associated with the isolated electric production facilities in common use today.

I think that by replacing electric references to compute references this  
would be an accurate description of our efforts and goals in grid computing.

It also seems relatively straight-forward to imagine how you could achieve this via workshops, education &#038; outreach, working groups, vendor contracts, standards, conventions, and policy definitions.

Our inter-operable infrastructure should naturally leverage as much of the existing investments as possible. For example, the equipment HPC centers already invest in and the identity processes that institutions already run. This inter-operable infrastructure is not meant to be &#8220;yet another set of standards&#8221; but a policy framework that allows communities to satisfy global goals with local choices.
