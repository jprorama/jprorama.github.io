The Linux environment has many advantages. The elegance of any design rests on its underpinning, and Linux has capabilities unmatched by most. It is solid. It is living. Its transparency ensures it will continue. Its development community is a model of the software process.

Linux has supported my desktop experience for well over 10 years. It&#8217;s been an overwhelmingly positive experience. A valuable tutor on software development, organization and design. The negatives, almost exclusively, are a reflection of pedantic hardware, software, and idea markets. 

Assembling a hardware profile that works with Linux is not difficult. Assembling one that is flawless requires tuning. Laptops from Dell have been surprisingly well supported out of the box by openSUSE. openSUSE is arguably one of the best desktop distro&#8217;s for KDE users. Little usability niggles remain and reflect tensions between server markets, desktop needs, and traditional designs. A small but useful example: I&#8217;ve experienced problems with the default permissions on the external DVD player. They prevent ordinary users from accessing the device file until root opens the permissions. Swapping the DVD resets the permissions. This isn&#8217;t the most ideal configuration profile for a device used for watching movies, which is what 99% of the population does with DVDs, including power users. Yes, this could be changed with one of the files in /etc, but the profile reflects traditional perspectives on device ownership and roles. Stepping past the hardware, anyone trying to play DVDs on Linux quickly becomes aware of the undue influence the content industry has the user experience. Pioneers of free culture are leading the way out, but the road is a long one. Outside these niggles, the KDE desktop is undergoing a major transition, with the promise of many good things to come. Transitions are never painless. 

The traditional Linux desktop experience could be much improved if I and millions of others around the globe could settle on a common, supportable hardware profile. The diversity of needs and variety of devices in the PC market almost ensures this won&#8217;t happen, at least not without significant, deliberate, intention or the leadership of a visionary manufacturer. It would take people amassing to form a &#8220;club&#8221; of users defined by a common hardware profile that evolves incrementally in a regular, predictable release cycle. These clubs exist, of course. We know them as PC manufactures, but they have, by and large, been very hostile to Linux. These clubs are not open, so we are limited by what the club owners care to provide. Apple is considered by many to be the leading design club offering a neat, integrated package but even their desktop designs are starting to lag a bit. 

Interestingly, one of the most open clubs is not even a hardware manufacture. VMware has steadily built a solid hardware abstraction layer that makes it easy to run as many system types as needed. It&#8217;s been mostly a software tools, however, and requires the user to construct the virtualization platform.

My ideal device, portable or not, would be one that reacts instantly to my interactions. Its operating state continually evolving to adapt to the level of complexity needed by my activities, with state preservation across idle periods managed by the hardware. I shouldn&#8217;t be required to tell the device to suspend itself or shut itself down. Shutdowns are, and always have been, related to failure events: power loss, design flaw, or ownership transfer.

Cell phones are the most common example of such devices. Laptops with close-the-lid-suspend-to-RAM are distant cousins. Forcing the user to manipulate the on and off state of devices is the legacy of dumb devices that couldn&#8217;t make smart decisions. The iPod has help shift perspectives and the netbook is reinventing the industry as a whole. Some hardware vendors are starting to leverage Linux-based BIOSes and virtualization, building devices that promise an experience where I can just start working, and, if more complex operating contexts are needed to support specific applications, they are instantiated as needed. Google&#8217;s Android is a tantalizing hint for the Linux world, but I&#8217;ll need to let their deep pockets and industry connections support broaden support beyond hand-held devices.

These transitions are likely to consume two 18 month product development cycles to shake out the bugs and dead ends. Three years from now, our expectations on device design and operation will be radically different. In the mean time, I want to experiment with a harmonious relationship between hardware and software for my front-line devices.

The closest thing to my ideal device today seems to be the Mac. Its is a reasonably elegant design built on a solid and flexible system foundation. It shares a Unix heritage with Linux. Combined with VMware, I&#8217;ll have a hardware abstraction layer that can run any system I need or want, production or experimental. The hardware-software integration should clearly benefit from Apple&#8217;s controlled hardware profiles, because Apple can take responsibility for their design in a way that other PC manufactures cannot. Manufacturers who deliver Microsoft software cannot approach this level of integration for the simple fact that they cannot control all the components in their design. (Choosing Linux is an obvious solution to this, but, outside the mobile phone market, there&#8217;s not significant up take.)

Though Apple&#8217;s design is legendary, I have reservations about Apple&#8217;s support during this experiment. My casual understanding suggests that everything is fine if you don&#8217;t need it, but if Apple doesn&#8217;t acknowledge your problem your S.O.L. There is little recourse with closed systems, regardless of the manufacturer.

So, for this next round while I wait out the transitions, I&#8217;ll choose a Mac.
