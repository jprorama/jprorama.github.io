In 1998, [Netscape released the source code for its browser][1]. Jaws dropped. In one news cycle, open source software was introduced to audiences around the world. The release preserved the openness of the world wide web and heralded an era of innovation that has redefined how we work.

Netscape credited [The Cathedral and The Bazaar][2] in justifying it&#8217;s decision to give away the crown jewels of the company. Eric Raymond&#8217;s influential paper contrasts two development models:  the centrally controlled and regulated growth of cathedrals and the loosely coordinated and organic growth of bazaars.

At the time Netscape made its decision, Linux was already demonstrating the strength and viability of the bazaar. People were taking notice, and not just software geeks.

The innovation of open source is a revolution in process. It [empowers individuals][3] to affect their lives and the world around them.

[Wikipedia][4] is the most prominent example of this process revolution. Wikipedia redefined how the world organizes knowledge by empowering the bazaar to build on individual contributions.

Accomplishing this feat required innovative thinking and innovative software.   A ground breaking knowledge repository required a tool where contributors can work freely and with confidence their effort cannot be usurped. [Mediawiki][5], the engine that drives Wikipedia, is as open to the world as the encyclopedia it supports.

As Wikipedia grows, so Mediawiki grows. This is the cycle of innovation.  Innovative creation of knowledge drives innovative software, which drives further innovations in capturing knowledge.

[Embracing this cycle][6] is the key to living innovatively. Choosing against it, marginalizes the impact of your effort.
