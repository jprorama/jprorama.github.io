Between the space crunch on my apps VM that blew up my wiki db, my oldest server (still rh7.2 <sorry>) finally succumbing to bot-hell and a working vacation, time has been been very tight over the past three weeks. The events have been good reminders of many lessons:

*   Distributed data survives disasters &#8212; thank you RSS
*   Data that&#8217;s on-line isn&#8217;t accessible when the network is down &#8212; Web2.0 doesn&#8217;t have a generic local &#8220;send&#8221; queue yet
*   Time crunches blow away extraneous concerns in a heart beat &#8212; focus on the most important, the rest will follow
*   Keep your work where others can see it &#8212; there&#8217;s no time to &#8220;write it up nice&#8221; later
*   Wiki&#8217;s are the best way to build data &#8212; set this up first and make it easy to post
*   It takes ten minutes to report a bug &#8212; don&#8217;t avoid building a todo list while you work

Bringing UABgrid2 on-line is coming along. The lost time does hurt, though. These reminders will help move the project forward in the end and are a good reminder about what&#8217;s critical when working rapidly. They highlight the infrastructure at the heart of so many successful open source projects. 

Using the tools you&#8217;re building for other to do your own work is they best way to make sure you aren&#8217;t foisting crap on others. By using the tools over and over, you&#8217;ll be forced to see the problem (and hopefully fix them) before others get there. I&#8217;m using mvb for UABgrid and it&#8217;s been a wonderful, but far from painless, experience. It&#8217;s cut through to the core issues fast and my plans to use mvb for openidp.org and myvocs.org will only increase the demand to document public for my own (and others) needs.
