We are fortunate to have one of the best jobs in the world. We solve [puzzles][1].

What&#8217;s the best thing about solving a puzzle? Sharing how you solved it!

When we share our solutions, we make it easy for others to solve the same puzzle. Better yet, we make it possible for someone else to take our solution, improve it, and use it solve a new puzzle, a puzzle we may have never encountered or imagined.

This is the open source model. Open source facilitates solution sharing. It provides a way for every consumer of a solution to become the producer of a new solution.

Open source preserves the [integrity][2] of relationships between people and technology. It provides a way for us to act consistently in the face of conflicting goals. When we deliver solutions that can be extended by other people, we give them the same power over their tools as we have over ours.

We share solutions to affirm our integrity. We share them because it&#8217;s [E][3].[A][4].[S][5].[I][6].[I][7].
