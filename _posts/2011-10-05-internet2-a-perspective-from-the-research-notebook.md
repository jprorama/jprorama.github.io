I reviewed the Internet2 program to highlight sessions of interest to share with colleagues and ended up casting them into a narrative around the work we have been doing over the past decade. I hope it shares a perspective that highlights our development of the research notebook in the context of the broader higher education community.<!--more-->

The heart of our collaboration platform is the group management framework we call [myVocs][1]. This platform and [openidp.org][2] are outcomes of our NSF grant to integrate open source applications with federated middleware (NSF ANI#0330543 2003-2006).  myVocs includes a [demonstration interface with grid identity management via GridShib][3] developed in collaboration with Von Welch at NCSA. GridShib now powers [CILogon.org][4] and provides end-user grid certificates to InCommon members.  Our work also sparked the development of [COManage][5], a project similar to myVocs with [steady representation at Internet2][6]. The collaboration paradigms represented by these tools have influenced the philosophy of resource sharing now promoted in NSF&#8217;s [XSEDE  program][7].

In 2007, under the umbrella of the UABgrid Pilot, we shifted our focus toward empowering collaborations across UAB and Alabama.  This effort provided the opportunity to collaborate with a variety of user groups in HPC, at ASA, CCC, CCTS, and LHL in order to demonstrate the functionality and hone the utility of our nascent research support platform:

*   our work with CCTS produced the patient cohort estimation database, ACE, which leverages federated identity management for our CTSA community, akin to [functionality demonstrated in California][8];
*   our work with LHL helped solidify the connection between the growing demand for data analysis, data storage and data curation into a comprehensive framework that builds on the resources of our pilot platform recast as the research notebook;
*   our architecture that focuses on comprehensive integration of best-of-breed applications is echoed by many institutions including [Duke][9];
*   open identity solutions are being further explored by initiatives like [OSIdM4HE][10];
*   statewide efforts like the [NC Education Cloud][11] reflects emerging demand;
*   custom data sharing tools like [Syndicate][12] highlight the continuous innovation and [support tooling][13] needed by researchers, tooling built directly into the research notebook.

The new VPIT strategic plan recognizes the significance of the research support efforts demonstrated in the course of the UABgrid Pilot as central to the mission of IT.  With our position solidified, we can move forward to leverage expertise and integrate support across IT as work begins on a formal organization for research support.  Infrastructure&#8217;s exploration of cloud data storage offerings from SoX, SDSC, Amazon, and the [AT&T-Internet2 partnership][14] is a great example of this deeper collaboration within IT.  The strategic adoption of research support by IT enables Research Computing to shift our focus toward research application support and fostering the development of user communities empowered by the data analysis, data archiving and data curation services of the research notebook.
