Curating digital artifacts is a natural process.  Our move to the digital world puts all of us in touch with expertise that is the lifeblood of library scientists, art historians, and museum curators: a disciplined interest in the artifacts of our past and the history of activity that surrounds them.  While we mostly fuss over our own data sets and minor interests, our own efforts benefit by exercising traits from the disciplines of experts.  The Internet has put us in touch with that knowledge and allows us to grow our skills as our understanding evolves.

Wikipedia succinctly defines [digital curation][1] as &#8220;the selection<sup id="cite_ref-ALA.2C_Scime_0-0"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_curation#cite_note-ALA.2C_Scime-0">[1]</a></sup>, [preservation][2], maintenance, collection and [archiving][3] of [digital][4] assets<sup id="cite_ref-dccdefn_1-0"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_curation#cite_note-dccdefn-1">[2]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-2"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_curation#cite_note-2">[3]</a></sup>.&#8221;  The tools of the Internet provide daily exposure to this trade.  Every Wikipedia page has a [history of edits][5] and [associated discussions][6] that document the evolution of a topic. This ability to record the natural evolution of our understanding is so ubiquitous in the tools that surround us that the concept of [sheer curation][7] has emerged  to describe the process of how we contribute to our archival records.  The word &#8220;sheer&#8221; is meant to emphasize the transparency of the process to our natural activities.  We work. Our tools document.

The term &#8220;sheer curation&#8221; has its origins in the [UK Digital Curation Centre&#8217;s SCARP project][8] and the challenges faced in meeting the [curation needs of neuroimaging data sets][9], but revisioned histories of our documentation of a process are common practice in the world of software development.  It&#8217;s hard to imagine approaching any project or any effort to document a process without the ability to step back in time, look at our decisions, recover from our mistakes, and explore new directions.  The ubiquity of these tools and understanding of this process is testament to the power of the open source community,  the strength of the discipline of software engineering, and the philosophy behind our [most flexible tools][10].  We have a need to document the natural history of our knowledge.

The research computing platform we are building is steeped in the spirit of sheer curation.  We are building an environment that records the context surrounding our [computations][11], our [projects][12], our [platform][13], our [ideas][14], and our [knowledge][15]. Our goal is a public record of the state and evolution of the environment in which we conduct our research: documented processes that can be incorporated by research teams,  influenced by research needs, and shared with peers.  This environment is integral to the [digital archive][16] of our research effort.  This is the research notebook.
