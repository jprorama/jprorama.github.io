It&#8217;s time for us to realize what we can do with a computer, and *reboot* isn&#8217;t part of the manual. 

We don&#8217;t need to be wasting our time coddling a system that can&#8217;t run along without interruption.

We&#8217;re systems people and we&#8217;re building a system to collaborate. If we can&#8217;t use it to collaborate for that effort then no &#8220;researcher&#8221; ever will. 

Note the quotes. A researcher is someone who continuously searches, finding new information and trying to keep track of the stuff already found.

This is what a collaboration environment needs to support. If we can&#8217;t use the system to build the system, then it&#8217;s not going to be useful to others who want to do the same: build their own *research information system*.
