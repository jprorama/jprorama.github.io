You may be familiar with the popular adage [*open source software is more secure than closed source software*][1].

The statement is less of an absolute in today&#8217;s marketplace than it was ten years ago, in the time before a prominent proprietary vendor was forced into a much more aggressive, and subsequently open, security posture due to the impact of several high profile exploits on their desktop software. This vendor was forced into an [open dialog about the shortcomings of their platform][2] and as a result became [more accountable for the quality of the products][3] they released into the market place.

This change was good for the software industry at large, raising awareness about the [quality of software and it&#8217;s impact on security][4]. It has led to higher quality software and processes from closed source as well as open source development teams.

Open processes invite accountability because they allow each person that depends on the upstream process to retain accountability for the successful outcome of their own efforts.

<!--more-->This is the motivation for 

[peer review][5] in the sciences, where open review of discoveries helps verify claims and ensures others can build new insight on well understood foundations. Peer review is inherent in open source software and the most successful open source software projects are successful because they build a very strong, open process around peer review and improvement of the software code base.

Open source software more naturally supports accountability because everyone is empowered to take the reigns to guide the process to a successful outcome.  [Don&#8217;t like what you see][6]?  [Fork it][7]!  If you can do it better, your code base and process will become the [community standard][8].

The benefits of open processes extend well beyond the world of software. Open processes are about getting the job done that you need done.  If you can see where a problem lies, you can understand it and help fix it, or, at the very least, you can [address your own needs][9]. You can get your job done and be accountable for it, because [you were in control][10].
