In April, UAB IT hosted a team from [ Dell][1] and [Inktank][2] to implement a cloud computing solution on the latest generation of hardware in our [Research Computing System][3].Â  This solution combines two prominent open source cloud tools, [OpenStack and Ceph][4], into a automated deploy and management fabric via [Crowbar][5], a fabric designed to support the continuous integration philosophies of [DevOps][6].

The new platform brings massively scalable storage and a very flexible application framework to the table for solving some of the most challenging problems researchers face today:

*   what to do with all the data generated by the latest generation of scientific instruments

*   how to analyze data with applications that have complex, interwoven, and often conflicting requirements

It also helps IT explore a new solutions strategy, a way of building out our computing infrastructure so we can keep moving forward at a steady, predictable pace while giving the user a set of tools to move forward at whatever pace their research demands. This platform is designed to put the [ user in control][7].
