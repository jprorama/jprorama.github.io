[Google says promote means][1] to further the progress of, to support, to actively encourage, or to publicize our aims. Promote is a positive word. The ideas we bring into the world create [the patterns that define our reality][2].

Promoting discovery is the aim of a research university.  Today&#8217;s most challenging research questions demand that we set aside dated assumptions about limited computing capacity and instead focus our energy toward building models that scale with the growth of our data. If we promote a [culture of scarcity][3] in the face of these problems, we will generate the inefficiencies of [fear, uncertainty and doubt][4] that hamper imagination[[1][5]].

Computers have freed us from constraint. They have allowed us to explore many dimensions and find the best solutions to the problems that confront us. They have given us the power to realize our imaginations.

Cloud computing promotes a culture of abundance. We should celebrate its power to transform how we approach our problems and work to share this freedom with others.  We should promote a culture of abundance and define a world where we create fearlessly, act with certainty, and live with confidence.
