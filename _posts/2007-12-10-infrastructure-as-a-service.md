On the topic of the changing face of infrastructure services and how grid computing and web2.0 technologies promise to redefine the organizational interfaces to customers, a [summary about Globecom07 in the OGF December 2007 Newsletter][1].

> OGF hosted the &#8220;Grids and Service-Oriented Networks Panel&#8221; at Globecom 2007 on November 27. This panel explored where grids could support the emerging concept of service-oriented networks, i.e., networks that are used and managed as a set of services&#8230; A common theme from this session was that web/grid standards, Web 2.0, virtualization, and the convergence of digital media and appliances all point towards the notion of a &#8220;soft telco&#8221; &#8212; that is to say, Service-Oriented Networks. BT&#8217;s Web21C, for example, is a web services and software development kit with the goal of hiding complexity and making it easy for end-users to &#8220;mash- up&#8221; their systems. 

The panel seems to be listed as [Grids, Networks and Virtualization][2] (scroll or search the page) and considered the concepts of virtualization of system and organizational elements in general. Essentially, how can the exposed interfaces of a virtual infrastructure be managed and leveraged in the emerging systems space.

Related to the panel discussion was a presentation on [Next Generation Networks by John Wittgreffe, of British Telecom][3]. He discussed the emergence of service oriented networks (SON) that enable application designers and developers outside the organization to leverage core infrastructure services directly. These types of infrastructure interfaces enable end users to directly solve their application needs and implement new models for collaboration and services directly. British Telcom is exploring this approach with their [Web21C toolkit][4].

> Within SON, Network resources, IT resources, and other telco capabilities are exposed for direct access by application designers and developers during D&#038;D&#8230; and by users at runtime. This enables for example, the Networks and IT to be adapted in real time according to an application&#8217;s immediate needs, to make sure the quality of experience is appropriate. 

While the presentation is focused on the space of telecommunication networks, it provides a solid example how the overall information technology infrastructure is being redesigned. Grid and Web 2.0 computing are about defining an infrastructure that is accessible across organization boundaries. They provide a development foundation that is as important within an organization as it is outside of the organization. Traditional internal developers and the vast array of external developers who work closely with researchers or departments can and should build upon the same infrastructure services. The main division between these groups will be the community of users they serve rather than the infrastructure interfaces they available.
