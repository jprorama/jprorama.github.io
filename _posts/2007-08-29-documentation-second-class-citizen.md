The truth is, writing documentation is hard work. There&#8217;s no way around it. It takes up time no matter how you approach it. 

You can save it all till you&#8217;re done with the &#8220;real&#8221; work or you can sprinkle it in-between. Documentation advances are more about letting the documentation happen in-line with the rest of your work than freeing you of this part of your work.

The best approach is to force yourself to put documenting in-line with your &#8220;real&#8221; work. Document as you go. It only seems like it&#8217;s slowing you down. 

The advantage of the &#8220;do it now&#8221; approach is that when you are done with your work, you really *are* done. If you save it all till the end, you&#8217;re only half done. You&#8217;re also in a weaker position to write because you&#8217;re less motivated to get this hard work done (especially since you felt you were already finished).

Find the tools that let you take care of it as you go. Wiki&#8217;s for code reviews. Language specific comments for code writing. There are plenty of tools out there to help, but doing the hard work is still up to you.
