The ideal information system is easy to build.  It is easy to build because it has only one requirement.

> user in control.  always.

You can understand this requirement if you see yourself as the user. You are always the user. To be effective and master your craft you must be in control of your tools.

This requirement resonates with our core values.  It is our natural instinct.  It reflects the [golden rule][1].  We are happiest when we [make choices that are concordant with our values][2]([pdf][3]).  We are happiest when we can create a space that supports our relationship with the world around us;  when we can create an environment that helps us get the job done.

We are empowered by an environment we can shape to meet our needs with tools we trust. This is a luxury that we share with users, because it is a luxury we want for our selves.
