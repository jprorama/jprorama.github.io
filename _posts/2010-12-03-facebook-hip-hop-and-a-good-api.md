Following up on a thread from the other day, the project from Facebook that converts PHP to C++ is called HipHop:

*   <https://github.com/facebook/hiphop-php/wiki/> 

Also, this page is well worth review for its content (open source projects from facebook), it&#8217;s message (here&#8217;s where we are involved in the community), and it&#8217;s design (simple, clean, informative):

*   <http://developers.facebook.com/opensource/> 

Finally, what better API to build compatibility layers against, than a nicely defined and easy to leverage system API:

Apps running directly on your platform (hello world):

*   <http://developers.facebook.com/docs/guides/canvas/> 

Web apps leveraging services of your platform (hello login):

*   <http://developers.facebook.com/docs/guides/web> 

Mobile apps leveraging (hello stats):

*   <http://developers.facebook.com/docs/guides/mobile/>
