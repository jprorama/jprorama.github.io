I need to catch up on all my notes for the last three days. There&#8217;s lots to document. I&#8217;ve essentially worked through a major debug session (more on that later) and because i didn&#8217;t have all the projects in place i needed it&#8217;s made it difficult to record the work in all in the right places. Parsing the nots should resolve how to manage these sessions. 

An important goal is to have dev boxes for uabgrid to support stand alone coding and testing. The infrastructure needs to be easily instantiated. It&#8217;s just an object. That&#8217;s been the motivation for mvb afterall. Its desirable to have a shib to idp to test against. The VMs really make this feasable. Dev VMs should be throw-away.
