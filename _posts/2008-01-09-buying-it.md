The [ goal of grid computing][1] and the motivation for building [UABgrid][2] is to expose an HPC, network, storage, and application infrastructure as a coordinated compute platform that satisfies the collaboration needs of researchers. The grid helps maximize compute power by aggregating distributed resources, providing managed expansion of infrastructure, and retaining user autonomy in application selection.

As we construct UABgrid, it will be helpful to regularly check our progress and align our efforts with the overall vision of &#8220;the grid&#8221; as a computational framework akin to the power grid. In this vision, computational power can be consumed as fluidly as we consume electrical power today. 

This is a grand vision, no doubt. But, a universal compute infrastructure has been [the goal of distributed systems since the first network crossed country][3].  
The vision is now materializing as standardized software interfaces and massive network bandwidth free isolated systems to re-combine into custom applications.

The electric grid is a useful model to help sort out the major components of the eventual grid computing infrastructure: generation, distribution, and consumption. [Electricity is generated][4] using a variety of technologies in different and often remote locations. [ Electricity is distributed][5] across an infrastructure managed by an electric utility, acting as a [broker][6] for consumer demand. Finally, [electricity is retailed to consumers][7] who remain free to choose their own applications for it.

The typical perspective for generating compute power doesn&#8217;t look exactly like electric production, where power is generated and moved to consumers. Compute power is seen as computations (applications and/or data) being moved to the compute power plant with results delivered to the consumer. 

To see the electric energy parallel more clearly, you need to concentrate on the second half of the process: delivering results of computation. The results, after all, are what people are interested in consuming. Electric power consumption isn&#8217;t about running the &#8220;light bulb&#8221; application. People are interested in the result: illumination.
