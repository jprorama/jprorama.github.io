There are so many ways to work on the web, one of the most powerful is writing documentation directly to it. Make your notes visible immediately, that way they can help out right away and you&#8217;ll often find yourself using them more than anything else.

I use a handful of different web editors to maintain documentation. The experience leaves me with the feeling that we&#8217;re still at a somewhat primitive state for editing on the web. Each application takes its own approach to document structure, markup, and workflow. It reminds me of the dedicated wordprocessor computers of the mid-&#8217;80s. Great for getting started with &#8220;wordprocessing&#8221;. Hell when you want move past their custom conventions.

The most consistent web applications today are the wiki&#8217;s, though their markup varies considerably. I use the [Trac wiki][1] and [MediaWiki][2] heavily. I like the both for different reasons. Trac is great for working with code, and has nice shortcuts into the rest of Trac that make project management a pleasure. A big downside of the wiki is that when pages get large, there is no way to edit portions of a page, like you can in MediaWiki. MediaWiki handles document growth much better. It&#8217;s subsection editing is convenient, especially the default comment prefix. The ability to manage pages is much more mature. You can rename them without breaking old links, freeing you to restructure your documentation without breaking relationships. MediaWiki&#8217;s downside is complex configuration.

I like [WordPress][3] for writing blogs because it nicely encapsulates the workflow common to blog writing. I especially like the &#8220;Save and Continue Editing&#8221; button. Wouldn&#8217;t that be nice on a wiki? Writing content with direct HTML markup, however, seems archaic, especially once you&#8217;ve visited wiki world.

[Drupal][4] is a powerful general purpose tool, but it&#8217;s too structured and gets in the way of writing. Wiki&#8217;s and blogs (and email) are so, sooo much better for writing. The more I use Drupal the more I realize I don&#8217;t want to construct my data there. What I want to do is *access* my data there. I want it to maintain an overview of work revolving around specific areas. It&#8217;s ability to consume feeds and other external data makes it a wonderful <ahem> content management system, my very own meta data manager. It can be a personal Technorati. 

These comments may just reflect a maturation in the understanding of tools, but it also serves as a reminder that &#8220;one size fits all&#8221; is a myth promoted by manufactures (be they ball cap makers or web developers). This reconfirms that the [myVocs][5] approach is the right one (at least, it fits my head). My integration interests revolve around maintaining my own user and group definitions consistently across all these tools and any domain boundary. I want my web desktop to have my Trac app, MediaWiki, and WordPress. I want to break the odd conventions of setup and configure and move on to install and wizard step throughs. Thanks to [Shibboleth][6] (and SAML), this is really possible. Now, if only we didn&#8217;t have to customize every web tool to do that (or have the pocketbook of a public institution to implement it).

Still on my wish list is the perfect bookmark manager. I use [Connotea: Code][7], but I really want a tool that automatically caches web content I bookmark (like Google&#8217;s cache) and lets me maintain commentary as a layer above it. Yes, I hear you, blogs! Drupal! plugins! Did you hear me? Whatever the tool, I should be able to add it to my web system environment with the same ease of adding apps to my desktop.
