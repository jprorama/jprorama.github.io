Containers are an effective tool for storing state during the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistics"> logistical operations</a> of distributed systems.</p>
<p>Practical isn&#8217;t necessarily pretty.  </p>
<p>It&#8217;s a testament of vision to show that beauty can be added where once only infrastructure was visible.<br />
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shipping_container_architecture">Shipping container architects</a> demonstrate  <a href="http://www.treehugger.com/files/2005/01/shipping_contai.php">art remains ahead of technology</a>.</p>
<p><img  align="left" src="http://i.treehugger.com/files/seatrain.JPG" alt="contained freedom" />I wouldn&#8217;t mind working <a href="http://www.designmobile.com/seatrain.html">working in this building</a>. Would you?</p>
<p>Maybe in my <a href="http://secondlife.com/">second life</a>.</p>
<p>For now, the gNOC (grid NOC) is concept.  There are some <a href="http://www.gridcenter.or.kr/GridNOC/index.php">good<a/> <a href="http://noc.ipgrid.org/">examples</a>. Our&#8217;s is more an <a href="http://www.unexplainable.net/artman/publish/article_1180.shtml">enthusiasts hang-out</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?articleId=B1027B68-E7F2-99DF-352186A04761EB7F">Containers of compute power</a> can be arranged like a <a href="http://www.slossfurnaces.com/media/html/sloss_story/index.html">field</a> of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_iron">pig iron</a>. Increased network bandwith supports remote generators. Distribution networks supply the compute power to applications as needed. gNOCs are the operating centers of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain">supply chain</a>.</p>
<p>The gNOC is the workplace.  gNOCs could also be contstructed out of containers.  gNOCs could even be virtual.  The last thing they should ever be, however, is ugly.</p>
