A common reaction that newcomers to open source software have upon hearing that the software is available at no cost is, &#8220;[If they give it away for free how can they make any money?][1]&#8221;

It&#8217;s a natural reaction, considering the software market culture that has evolved since the 1980&#8242;s, but it misses the core motive for open source: [freedom][2].

Open source software is designed to grant freedom of choice to the communities that use, develop and support the software.   A key result of this freedom is the creation of [an open market for the exchange of services][3] related to the software.

Examples of services abound. They include installation support, packaging, custom enhancements, documentation, training, and data preservation. And there lies the answer to the original question: the open source economy is driven by service.

[Billion dollar companies][4] have been built on the service they provide to users of freely-available open source software. Organizations who build their future on a foundation of open source preserve self determination because no central authority can monopolize control over the source code.

The open source market remains free and welcomes any entrant working to improve the lives of others through their service.
